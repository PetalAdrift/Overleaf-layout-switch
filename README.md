# Overleaf layout switch

## functionality

Overleaf Layout Switch is an essential browser extension tailored specifically for Overleaf users who may benefit from a reversed layout.

This extension adds a new button to the top-right corner (toolbar) of the Overleaf interface. This button allows users to switch between the default layout and a new layout with the PDF preview on the left hand side and the editor on the right hand side.

## install

You may either `git clone https://github.com/PetalAdrift/Overleaf-layout-switch.git` to your local machine and install the extension manually (requires manually changing a few flags for most browsers) or install via the official add-on stores for [Chromium-based browsers](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/overleaf-layout-switch/coichnmomonknijjfjfikhalkfhjchdc) (Chrome, Edge, etc.) or [Gecko-based browsers](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/overleaf-layout-switch/) (Firefox etc.).
